1. What is SDLC?; "Software Development Life Cycle is a well-defined, structured sequence of stages in software engineering to develop the intended software product."
2. What does SDLC provide?; "SDLC provides a series of steps to be followed to design and develop a software product efficiently."
3. What is the first step in SDLC?; "The first step is Communication where the user initiates the request for a desired software product."
4. What is the second step in SDLC?; "The second step is Requirement Gathering where the software development team works to carry on the project."
5. What are the requirements segregated into during Requirement Gathering?; "The requirements are contemplated and segregated into user requirements, system requirements and functional requirements."
6. What is the third step in SDLC?; "The third step is Feasibility Study where the team analyzes if a software can be made to fulfill all requirements of the user."
7. What is analyzed during Feasibility Study?; "It is found out, if the project is financially, practically and technologically feasible for the organization to take up."
8. What is the fourth step in SDLC?; "The fourth step is System Analysis where the developers decide a roadmap of their plan and try to bring up the best software model suitable for the project."
9. What is included in System Analysis?; "System analysis includes Understanding of software product limitations, learning system related problems or changes to be done in existing systems beforehand, identifying and addressing the impact of project on organization and personnel etc."
10. What is the fifth step in SDLC?; "The fifth step is Software Design."
What are the inputs of the software design step?; "Inputs from users and information gathered in requirement gathering phase"
What are the two designs produced in the software design step?; "Logical design and physical design"
What do engineers produce in the software design step?; "Meta-data and data dictionaries, logical diagrams, data-flow diagrams and in some cases pseudo codes"
What is the coding step also known as?; "Programming phase"
What is the implementation of software design in terms of?; "Writing program code in the suitable programming language and developing error-free executable programs efficiently"
What percentage of the whole software development process should be tested according to an estimate?; "50%"
Who conducts thorough testing at various levels of code such as module testing, program testing, product testing, in-house testing and testing the product at userâ€™s end?; "Testing experts"
What is involved in the integration stage of SDLC?; "Integration of software with outer world entities"
What does implementation mean in the SDLC?; "Installing the software on user machines"
What confirms the software operation in terms of more efficiency and less errors?; "Operation and maintenance phase"
What may the software need during the operation and maintenance phase?; "Post-installation configurations at user end"
What is the disposition phase?; "Archiving data and required software components, closing down the system, planning disposition activity and terminating system at appropriate end-of-system time"
What may happen to the software as time elapses?; "It may decline on the performance front"
What may the software need as time elapses?; "Intense upgradation"
What is the pressing need in the disposition phase?; "To eliminate a major portion of the system"
What is a software development paradigm?; "It helps developers to select a strategy to develop the software and has its own set of tools, methods, and procedures."
What are some examples of software development paradigms or process models?; "Waterfall Model, Iterative Model, Spiral Model"
What is the Waterfall Model?; "The simplest model of software development paradigm where all phases of SDLC function one after another in a linear manner."
What does the Waterfall Model assume?; "That everything is carried out and taken place perfectly as planned in the previous stage and there is no need to think about past issues that may arise in the next phase."
When is the Waterfall Model best suited?; "When developers have already designed and developed similar software in the past and are aware of all its domains."
What is the Iterative Model?; "A model that leads the software development process in iterations and projects the process of development in a cyclic manner repeating every step after every cycle of SDLC process."
What happens on every next iteration in the Iterative Model?; "More features and modules are designed, coded, tested, and added to the software."
What is produced after each iteration in the Iterative Model?; "A software which is complete in itself and has more features and capabilities than that of the previous one."
What is the Spiral Model?; "A combination of both iterative model and one of the SDLC model."
How can the Spiral Model be seen?; "As if you choose one SDLC model and combine it with cyclic process iterative model."
1. What is the major drawback of waterfall model?; "We move to the next stage only when the previous one is finished and there was no chance to go back if something is found wrong in later stages."
2. What is the V-Model?; "It provides means of testing of software at each stage in reverse manner."
3. What is done at every stage in the V-Model?; "Test plans and test cases are created to verify and validate the product according to the requirement of that stage."
4. What is the Big Bang Model?; "The simplest model in its form. It requires little planning, lots of programming and lots of funds."
5. What is the concept behind the Big Bang Model?; "Conceptualized around the big bang of universe. As scientists say that after big bang lots of galaxies, planets and stars evolved just as an event."
6. Is planning required for the Big Bang Model?; "Very small amount of planning is required."
7. Is the Big Bang Model suitable for large software projects?; "No, it is not suitable for large software projects but good one for learning and experimenting."
8. What is the name of the model that considers risk?; "Not specified."
9. What is the first phase of the model that considers risk?; "Determining objectives and constraints of the software at the start of one iteration."
10. What is done in the second phase of the model that considers risk?; "Prototyping the software. This includes risk analysis."
11. What model is used to build the software in the model that considers risk?; "One standard SDLC model is used to build the software."
12. What is done in the fourth phase of the plan in the model that considers risk?; "Prepared for the next iteration."
13. What is another name for the V-Model?; "Verification and validation model."
14. What is done in the requirement gathering stage of the V-Model?; "The test team prepares all the test cases in correspondence to the requirements."
15. What verifies the software against its validity towards requirements at a certain stage in the V-Model?; "Test cases of this stage verify the software against its validity towards requirements at this stage."
16. What goes in parallel in the V-Model?; "Both verification and validation go in parallel."
17. Is the V-Model suitable for large software projects?; "Not specified."
18. What is the purpose of the link provided at the end of the text?; "For an in-depth reading on SDLC and its various models."
19. Can the Big Bang Model follow a process?; "No, it does not follow any process."
20. What are the input requirements for the Big Bang Model?; "The input requirements are arbitrary."
