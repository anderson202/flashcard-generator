What is SDLC?;"Software Development Life Cycle is a well-defined, structured sequence of stages in software engineering to develop the intended software product."
What are the steps included in the SDLC framework?;"The SDLC framework includes the following steps: Communication, Requirement Gathering, Feasibility Study, System Analysis, Software Design, Coding, Testing, Integration, Implementation, Operation and Maintenance, Disposition."
What is the first step in SDLC?;"The first step in SDLC is Communication where the user initiates the request for a desired software product."
What is requirement gathering?;"Requirement gathering is the step where the software development team works to carry on the project. The team holds discussions with various stakeholders from problem domain and tries to bring out as much information as possible on their requirements."
What is feasibility study in SDLC?;"Feasibility study is the step where the team analyzes if a software can be made to fulfill all requirements of the user and if there is any possibility of software being no more useful. It is found out, if the project is financially, practically and technologically feasible for the organization to take up."
What is software design in SDLC?;"Software design is the step where the whole knowledge of requirements and analysis is brought down on the desk and the software product is designed. The inputs from users and information gathered in requirement gathering phase are the inputs of this step."
What is coding in SDLC?;"Coding is the step where the implementation of software design starts in terms of writing program code in the suitable programming language and developing error-free executable programs efficiently."
What is testing in SDLC?;"Testing is the step where software is tested for errors while coding by the developers and thorough testing is conducted by testing experts at various levels of code such as module testing, program testing, product testing, in-house testing and testing the product at userâ€™s end."
What is implementation in SDLC?;"Implementation means installing the software on user machines. At times, software needs post-installation configurations at user end. Software is tested for portability and adaptability and integration related issues are solved during implementation."
What is operation and maintenance in SDLC?;"Operation and Maintenance phase confirms the software operation in terms of more efficiency and less errors. The software is maintained timely by updating the code according to the changes taking place in user end environment or technology."
What is disposition in SDLC?;"Disposition is the phase where a pressing need to eliminate a major portion of the system arises as time elapses. This phase includes archiving data and required software components, closing."
